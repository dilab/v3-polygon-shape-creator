#Polygon Shape Creator(for Google Maps)
this is forked from [thedilab/v3-polygon-shape-creator](https://github.com/thedilab/v3-polygon-shape-creator)
its a cool library for adding polygons to a map and specifying areas using it, except that it was not supporting multi polygon adding.
**so this fork's main feature is to support adding many polygons and getting their Coordinates.**
